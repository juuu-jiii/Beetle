/*
    Issues with spawning:
    - you cannot spawn in rapid fire - there will be collisions and then the 
        marbles won't move in desired directions. So you should delay the actual
        spawning
    - What happens if, while spawning, the player destroys a marble?
        I was thinking of making spawning a 2-step process. In each spawner's
        script, a List<GameObject> of to-be-spawned marbles will be "buffered".
        In the script's Update(), new marbles will be instantiated at regular
        time intervals. Each time an instantiation occurs, the corresponding
        marble will be removed from the buffer and added to the GameManager's
        "master" List.
